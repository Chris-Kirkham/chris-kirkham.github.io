            <h3>Target following</h3>
            <p>Each boid attempts to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay a certain distance from other boids</li>
                <li>Match velocity with that of nearby boids</li>
                <li>Move towards the centre of nearby boids</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <h3>Collision avoidance</h3>
            <p>Affectors are objects placed in the scene which influence the movement of a boid which enters its range. There are currently three types of affectors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Attractor - pulls boids within its range into its centre</li>
                <li>Repulsor - repels boids that come within its range</li>
                <li>Pusher - pushes boids that come within its range in a predefined direction</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <h3>Occlusion avoidance</h3>
            <p>Boids may be set to follow a 3D target. In the demo, this is controlled by the player's mouse position.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div id="project-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <h3>Target following</h3>
            <p>The boids' flocking behaviour is implemented using compute shaders; this allows the behaviour of many boids to be calculated in parallel, and provides a significant performance increase over a typical CPU-based implementation.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Collision avoidance</h3>
            <p>This is a variant of the basic GPU flocking which divides the flock into batches of boids and executes each batch on consecutive frames; thus, the entire flock is updated over n frames, where n is the number of batches the flock is divided into. With large flocks, and when the number of batches is kept small (&lt;8 frames is good) this method provides a great performance boost with no discernible impact to boid behaviour.</p>
