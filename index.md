## About me
Hello! I am a recent graduate in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence (BSc Hons) from the University of Nottingham.
As a programmer, I am interested in AI, especially intelligent agents and machine learning; as an avid gamer and aspiring game developer, I find particularly exciting the potential for unique and emergent player experience through the use of intelligent agents, procedural generation and other simulated systems.
