#### Game development, AI, and music. BSc Hons Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence, University of Nottingham (2018).

## About me
Hello! I am a recent graduate in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence (BSc Hons) from the University of Nottingham.
As a programmer, I am (unsurprisingly) interested in AI, especially intelligent agents and machine learning; as an avid gamer and aspiring game developer, I find particularly exciting the potential for unique and emergent player experience through the use of intelligent agents, procedural generation and other simulated systems. Some of my favourite examples of this include [the "AI Director" in Valve's Left 4 Dead series](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2009/ai_systems_of_l4d_mike_booth.pdf#page=55), the simulated ecosystem of [Rain World](http://rainworldgame.com/), and all of Deus Ex.

As well as gaming, I am passionate about music - I've been playing piano and other instruments both solo and in ensembles since I was a child, and enjoy composing my own music in my spare time. One of my career goals it to be able to explore the possibilities of music generated/influenced by AI in a video game context.
