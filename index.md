#### Software development, AI, and music. BSc Hons Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence, University of Nottingham (2018).

## About me
Hello! I am a recent graduate in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence (BSc Hons) from the University of Nottingham.
As a programmer, I am (unsurprisingly) interested in AI, especially intelligent agents and machine learning; I also like game development and theory (especially the potential for emergent player experience through the use of simulated systems), computer graphics, and really anything which leverages the unique power of the computer in a creative way.

As well as computing, I am passionate about music - I've been playing piano and other instruments both solo and in ensembles since I was a child, and enjoy composing my own music in my spare time.  

You can find all my personal projects at <https://github.com/chris-kirkham/>, and email me at <chris.kirkham11@gmail.com>.
